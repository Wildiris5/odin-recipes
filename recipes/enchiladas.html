  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    One of the recipes my family makes often is Acapulco enchiladas. It comes from my grandfather, who lived in Mexico for many years. The following recipe is a combination of what I remember and general advice for making enchiladas.  
  </p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 package flour tortillas</li>
    <li>1 jar salsa</li>
    <li>1 package shredded Mexican-style cheese</li>
    <li>1 rotisserie chicken (avoid ones with special seasonings/flavoring- just go for a regular one)</li>
    <li>1 can black beans or pinto beans (optional)</li>
    <li>green or red enchilada sauce (optional)</li>
    <li>1 package slivered almonds (optional)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Remove the meat from the rotisserie chicken and place in a large mixing bowl. I usually do this with my fingers or with a knife/fork. The idea is to have small, bite-size pieces you can use in the enchilada filling.</li>
    <li>Add some beans and slivered almonds to the bowl if desired. I don't have a measurement for this, I just add some and mix and see if that is an amount that looks good. So, add in slowly.</li>
    <li>Add some salsa to the bowl, mixing until the filling is moist but not too runny. I "eyeball" this as well- you're going for a consistency that is easy to place in the tortillas but will keep the filling from getting too dry as it bakes.</li>
    <li>Get a baking pan/dish (one that has some depth to hold the enchiladas) and coat the bottom and sides lightly with some salsa. (This helps keep the enchiladas moist and prevents sticking.)</li>
    <li>Place some tortillas in the pan. You want them to be upright and side-by-side, like taco shells. Fill the entire pan.</li>
    <li>With a large spoon, place the mixed filling into the tortillas. Wrap them up, one side down then the other, and flip so the bottom of the tortilla is facing up. Repeat for each tortilla until they are all filled and flipped over in the pan.</li>
    <li>Spread some salsa or some of the enchilada sauce on the tops of the tortillas in an even layer.</li>
    <li>Get the package of cheese and pour some over the tortillas, creating an even layer on top.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350°F.</li>
    <li>When the oven is at the specified temperature, place the pan/dish in the oven and bake for 15 to 20 minutes. The cheese should be melted and the top slightly browned.</li>
  </ol>

  Additional notes: If you like black olives, feel free to add some (sliced or diced) to the enchilada filling prior to baking.
