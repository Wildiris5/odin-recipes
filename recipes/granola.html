  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    This is my grandmother's homemade granola recipe. She recommended serving it with plain, low-fat yogurt (with live cultures) and dark berries. 
  </p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 cups of old fashioned thick rolled oats</li>
    <li>1/4 cup oat bran or rice bran</li>
    <li>1 cup walnuts whole and half pieces</li>
    <li>1/4 cup canola oil</li>
    <li>1/4 cup pure organic maple syrup</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons of vanilla extract</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Mix the dry ingredients together in a large bowl.</li>
    <li>Add the liquid ingredients to the bowl and mix together thoroughly. (If it seems very dry once mixed, add a little more oil.)</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 250°F.</li>
    <li>Place granola mixture in a shallow baking pan, spreading out evenly.</li>
    <li>Once oven is heated to 250°F, place pan in oven (on the center rack - use oven mits or be careful not to touch the oven) and bake for about an hour, stirring every so often.</li>
    <li>Remove pan from oven (using oven mits) when granola is browned and crispy. You can vary the time depending on your oven and how crunchy you like your granola.</li>
  </ol>
